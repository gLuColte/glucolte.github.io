# Math & Bit Manipulation

**Patterns to know:**  
- GCD / LCM.  
- Modular Arithmetic.  
- Fast Exponentiation.  
- Bitmask DP.  
- XOR tricks (Single Number).  

**How to identify:**  
- Involves divisibility, prime, modulo.  
- Input constraints very large (10^9) → need log-time math.  
- "Subsets" and n ≤ 20 → bitmask.
