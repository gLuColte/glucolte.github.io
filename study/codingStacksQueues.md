# Stacks & Queues

**Patterns to know:**  
- Monotonic Stack (Next Greater Element, Stock Span).  
- Stack for Parsing (Valid Parentheses, Min Stack).  
- Queue for BFS (Shortest Path in Grid).  
- Double-ended queue for sliding window maximum.

**How to identify:**  
- Matching or balancing problem → stack.  
- "Next greater/smaller" → monotonic stack.  
- Level-by-level traversal or shortest path → queue.
