# Dynamic Programming

**Patterns to know:**  
- 1D DP (Fibonacci, House Robber).  
- 2D DP on Grids (Unique Paths, Min Path Sum).  
- Subsequence DP (LIS, LCS, Edit Distance).  
- Knapsack Variants.  
- Interval DP (Burst Balloons).  
- State Machine DP (Stocks).  
- State Compression (Bitmask DP).  
- Digit DP (counting numbers under constraints).

**How to identify:**  
- Problem asks for "maximum/minimum ways, cost, length".  
- Overlapping subproblems (same input repeated).  
- Optimal substructure (global optimum = combination of local optima).  
- Often solved recursively → memoization → tabulation.
