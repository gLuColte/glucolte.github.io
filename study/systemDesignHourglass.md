## Scenario 1: Realtime Temperature Monitoring with IoT Sensors

Design a system that collects temperature data from 1 million IoT devices across NSW and publishes:

- A real-time pixelated temperature heatmap (~10s latency).
- A historical dashboard with daily/weekly/monthly min/max temperatures per region.
- Historical retention: 6 months.

### 1. **Source**

**What produces the data?**

- **1M IoT devices** deployed across NSW
- Each emits a temperature reading every **10 seconds**
- Format:

  ```json
  {
    "device_id": "abc123",
    "timestamp": 1723049840,
    "temperature": 26.5
  }
  ```

**Protocol Chosen**: `MQTT`

**Why**: Lightweight, supports millions of persistent low-power clients, ideal for IoT telemetry.

---

### 2. **Type**

**What kind of data?**

- **Structured, time-series**
- Schema is **fixed** and simple
- JSON at ingest, but stored in optimized binary

---

### 3. **Storage**

**How is the data stored, and what format?**

#### a. **Real-Time Table**

| Field        | Type   | Size               |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------ |
| device_id    | UInt32 | 4B                 |
| temp         | Float  | 4B                 |
| last_updated | UnixTS | 8B                 |
| Total        |        | **16B** per device |

‚Üí `1M devices * 16B = 16 MB` (not GB!)

#### b. **Historical Data**

For each sensor:

- Store **daily min/max** ‚Üí 2 floats + 2 timestamps
  ‚Üí 16B per day ‚Üí `1M * 180 days * 16B = 2.88 GB`

Add device metadata table:

- device_id, uuid, lat, long ‚Üí 20B √ó 1M ‚Üí **\~20 MB**

#### ‚úÖ Final Estimation:

| Table           | Estimated Size |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Realtime Table  | \~16 MB        |
| Daily Table     | \~2.88 GB      |
| Weekly/Monthly  | Aggregated     |
| Device Metadata | \~20 MB        |
| **Total**       | **\~3.5 GB**   |

---

### 4. **Preprocessing / Compute**

**What processing is done pre-store or during ingestion?**

- Real-time table: **UPDATE on each incoming reading**
- Daily table: compare reading to current min/max ‚Üí update if necessary
- Weekly/monthly: daily aggregation jobs (batch via scheduled job)

**Tech Suggestion**:

- AWS Lambda or ECS service for MQTT message processing
- Use `Redis` for fast in-memory compare/write for real-time updates
- Then batch-write to TimescaleDB / Postgres

---

### 5. **API (Data Interface)**

**How does the frontend consume the data?**

- **Realtime map**:

  - Uses **REST API** with client polling every 10 seconds
  - Endpoint hits `realtime_table`

- **Historical dashboard**:

  - REST endpoint to query `daily_table`, `weekly_table`

**Why polling over WebSocket?**

- Map is pixelated & low-resolution, not per-device ‚Üí avoid 1M WebSocket updates
- 100 users/hour is low load
- Polling at 10s interval is simpler, cheaper to maintain, and sufficient

---

### 6. **Client / Presentation**

**What are the frontend requirements?**

- Web map view: grid overlay updated every 10s
- Historical dashboard with calendar filter
- No user authentication

---

### 7. **Security**

- No login needed, but:
  - Throttle API to avoid DoS (e.g., CloudFront + WAF)
- Edge - MQTT broker authentication with certs

---

### 8. **Scalability**

- Write-heavy system (1M writes every 10s = \~100K writes/sec)
- Use **Kafka** or **Kinesis** as buffer between MQTT and DB
- DB partitioned on `device_id` and time
- Stateless API ‚Üí auto-scalable

---

### 9. **Reliability**

- MQTT ‚Üí At Least Once delivery
- Ingest pipeline retry logic
- If device fails ‚Üí last_seen timestamp in DB
- If aggregation job fails ‚Üí re-run from daily table

---

### 10. **Observability**

- Metrics:

  - MQTT message rate
  - Write latency
  - Failed writes
  - Last_seen_age per sensor

- Logs:

  - Ingestion pipeline
  - API access logs

---

### 11. **Environment / Infra**

- Cloud-native (AWS):

  - **MQTT**: AWS IoT Core or EMQX
  - **Buffer**: Kinesis or Kafka
  - **Processing**: ECS, Fargate, or Lambda
  - **Storage**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
  - **API**: FastAPI or Flask on Fargate
  - **Infra**: IaC with Terraform/CDK
