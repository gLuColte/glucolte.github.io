# Greedy

**Patterns to know:**  
- Interval Scheduling (merge intervals, meeting rooms).  
- Jump Game.  
- Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal/Prim sometimes considered greedy).  
- Huffman Encoding.  

**How to identify:**  
- Problem allows making a "local best choice".  
- Sorting first often helps.  
- Proof usually shows greedy choice = optimal.
