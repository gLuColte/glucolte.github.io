# Hashing & Sets

**Patterns to know:**  
- Frequency Map (character counts, anagrams).  
- HashSet for uniqueness (Longest Consecutive Sequence).  
- Two Sum with HashMap.  

**How to identify:**  
- Problem requires fast lookup or counting.  
- Often reduces O(n^2) â†’ O(n) with hashing.  
- Keywords: "unique", "frequency", "group by".
