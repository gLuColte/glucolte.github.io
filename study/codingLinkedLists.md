# Linked Lists

**Patterns to know:**  
- Fast/Slow Pointers (detect cycle, find middle).  
- Dummy Node Technique.  
- Reversal (full or partial).  
- Merge Two/K Sorted Lists.  

**How to identify:**  
- Input involves nodes with `.next`.  
- Questions about "cycle detection" or "reorder/reverse" → pointer tricks.  
- Merging multiple lists → heap or divide & conquer.
