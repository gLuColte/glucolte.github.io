# Trees

**Patterns to know:**  
- DFS Recursion (preorder, inorder, postorder).  
- BFS Level Order Traversal.  
- Divide & Conquer (build/validate BST, LCA).  
- Path Problems (Path Sum, Diameter).  

**How to identify:**  
- Input is `root` node.  
- Recursion naturally fits.  
- "Sum of paths / height / balanced?" → DFS.  
- "Level order / shortest path?" → BFS.
