## 1. AWS Network Overview {#section-1-aws-network-overview}

AWS operates one of the largest private **fiber-optic backbones** in the world. This backbone connects **Data Centers**, groups them into **Availability Zones (AZs)**, and links multiple AZs to form a **Region**. From there, AWS extends outwards through **Points of Presence (PoPs)**, which connect to the **public internet** or provide private connectivity via **Direct Connect**.  

1. **Data Centers, AZs, and Regions**  
- **Data Centers** are the physical foundation.  
- A group of data centers = an **Availability Zone (AZ)**.  
- Several AZs = a **Region**, interconnected by the AWS backbone for **low-latency, fault-tolerant networking**.  

2. **Points of Presence (PoPs)**  
- AWS racks hosted inside **third-party colocation sites** (e.g., *Equinix, Digital Realty*).  
- Link the AWS backbone to **local ISPs** and **IXPs**.  
- Run edge services such as **CloudFront** (CDN caching) and **Global Accelerator** (traffic optimization).  

3. **Public Internet Connectivity**  
- PoPs handle AWS traffic **in and out of the public internet**.  
- Customers reach AWS services through **public endpoints** (e.g., *S3, EC2 APIs*).  

4. **Direct Connect (DX)**  
- A **dedicated private link** that bypasses the internet.  
- Provisioned at a PoP, giving you a **physical port on AWS gear**.  
- Delivers **lower latency, higher reliability, and consistent bandwidth** for hybrid cloud workloads.

## 3. VPN {#section-3-vpn}

Note VPN builds on top of IPSec, for details on how IPSec works, see [3.4 Layer 3 & 5‚Äì6 - IPsec]({{ '/study/infrastructureOsiModel#layer-3-56---ipsec' | relative_url }})

### 3.1 Site-to-Site VPN {#section-3-1-site-to-site-vpn}

- **Purpose**:  
  - **Site-to-Site VPN = Network ‚Üî Network**  
  - Connects an entire on-premises network (via a CGW) to an AWS VPC network (via a VGW or TGW).  
  - Used for **hybrid cloud connectivity**, extending datacenter or branch office networks into AWS.  
  - **Example**: Your office LAN can securely reach EC2 instances inside VPCs.

    ISP -> Internet : Forwards Traffic to Backup Tunnel
    Internet -> VPC : Routes Traffic to Backup Tunnel
end

OnPrem -> VPC : Routes Traffic to VPC
OnPrem -> VPC : Continuous keep-alive messages
VPC -> VPC : Acknowledges Keep-alive

' Floating note at the very bottom
note across
  If you replace VGW with TGW (Transit Gateway),  
  the VPN becomes a scalable solution that can connect to multiple VPCs.  
  This allows a central hub (TGW) to route traffic between various VPCs,  
  providing more flexibility and scalability in larger environments.

#### 3.1.1 Connectivity Types {#section-3-1-1-connectivity-types}

Keep in mind, VPN connections traverse the public Internet before reaching AWS‚Äôs network. Because of this, the routing path and how routes are exchanged are critical.

- **Static VPN**
  - **Route**: Static routes in route tables (manual setup).  
  - **Pros**: Simple setup.  
  - **Cons**: No load balancing or failover.  

- **Dynamic VPN**
  - **Route**: Uses **BGP** for automatic route exchange.  
  - **Pros**: High availability, automatic failover, and load balancing.  
  - **Cons**: More complex setup.  


#### 3.1.2 Deployment Workflow {#section-3-1-2-deployment-workflow}

- **Step 1: Create TGW and Attachments**  
  - Create TGW (default RT = **Route Table A**).  
  - Attach: **VPC1**, **VPC2**, and **On-premises** (via VPN or Direct Connect).  
  - Notes on VPN connectivity:  
    - Uses the **AWS Global Network**, but tunnels still traverse the **public Internet**.  
    - Provides **2 resilient public endpoints** with **2 IPSec tunnels** for redundancy.  
    - Performance, latency, and consistency vary due to Internet hops.  

- **Step 2: Configure TGW Route Table & Associations**  
  - By default, all attachments are **associated** with the TGW‚Äôs default route table (**Route Table A**).  
  - You can create **custom TGW route tables** and associate attachments to them for segmentation (e.g., Dev vs Prod).  
  - For this setup, keep **VPC1**, **VPC2**, and **On-premises** associated to **Route Table A**, but remove cross-VPC routes so **VPC1 ‚Üî VPC2** traffic is blocked.  

- **Step 3: Configure VPC Route Tables**  
  - **VPC1 RT**: Add `0.0.0.0/0` ‚Üí TGW Attachment (for On-prem). No route to VPC2.  
  - **VPC2 RT**: Add `0.0.0.0/0` ‚Üí TGW Attachment (for On-prem). No route to VPC1.  

- **Step 4: On-premises Integration (Propagation)**  
  - Enable **propagation** from On-prem ‚Üí TGW RT so both VPCs can learn routes automatically.  
  - Ensure On-prem routes are advertised back to TGW.  
  - Options to connect:  
    1. **VGW ‚Üí CGW (1:1 VPC)**  
    2. **TGW ‚Üí CGW (1:M VPCs)**  
    3. **Accelerated Site-to-Site VPN (TGW only)**  
    4. **Direct Connect (DX)**:  
       - **Private VIF** ‚Üí For VPC connectivity via TGW/VGW.  
       - **Public VIF** ‚Üí For AWS public services (not VPC routing).  
       - **Transit VIF** ‚Üí For scaling via TGW to multiple VPCs (enterprise-scale option).  

- **Step 5: BGP Exchange Sequence (Dynamic VPN)**  
  1. **On-Prem Router Configures BGP ASN** ‚Üí prepares to exchange routes.  
  2. **Advertises Internal Routes** ‚Üí on-prem router sends subnets (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).  
  3. **AWS VPN Gateway Setup** ‚Üí VPN tunnels established.  
  4. **BGP Peering** ‚Üí session formed between on-prem router and AWS VPN Gateway.  
  5. **Route Advertisement** ‚Üí AWS advertises VPC subnets to the on-prem router.  
  6. **Route Learning** ‚Üí on-prem router learns AWS subnets via BGP.  
  7. **Traffic to AWS** ‚Üí routed to TGW using BGP-learned paths.  
  8. **TGW Forwarding** ‚Üí TGW routes traffic to the correct VPC.  
  9. **Return Traffic from AWS** ‚Üí VPC ‚Üí TGW ‚Üí VPN tunnels ‚Üí back to on-prem router.  

- **Resulting Traffic Flows**
  - **VPC1 ‚Üí TGW ‚Üí On-premises** ‚úÖ  
  - **VPC2 ‚Üí TGW ‚Üí On-premises** ‚úÖ  
  - **VPC1 ‚Üî VPC2** ‚ùå (blocked by TGW RT config)  

#### 3.1.3 Operational Considerations {#section-3-1-3-operational-considerations}

- **Speed**: Maximum throughput is **1.25 Gbps** per VPN tunnel.  
- **Latency**: Varies and can be inconsistent, as traffic traverses the public Internet.  
- **Cost**: Hourly charges per VPN connection, plus standard AWS data transfer fees (outbound GB).  
- **Provisioning Speed**: Quick to set up, as VPNs are software-based and do not require physical circuits.  
- **High Availability**:  
  - Each VPN connection can support two tunnels for redundancy.  
  - HA depends on having multiple on-premises customer gateways (e.g., in different locations).  
- **Integration with Direct Connect**:  
  - VPNs can serve as a **backup for DX** (failover).  
  - VPN and DX can be used together for **hybrid redundancy**.  

---

### 3.2 Client VPN {#section-3-2-client-vpn}

AWS Client VPN is a **fully managed OpenVPN-based service** that allows **individual users** (laptops, developers, admins, remote workers) to securely connect to AWS resources and on-premises networks.  

- **Purpose**:
  - **Client VPN = User ‚Üî Network**  
  - Unlike Site-to-Site VPN (which connects entire networks), Client VPN provides **user-level access** into AWS.  

- **Architecture**:
  - Users connect to a **Client VPN Endpoint** deployed in a VPC.  
  - The endpoint is associated with one or more **subnets (ENIs)** across AZs for high availability.  
  - Billed based on the number of **network associations** and connected clients.  

- **Use Cases**:
  - Remote workforce access to AWS resources in a VPC.  
  - Secure developer/admin access without requiring a full corporate VPN.  
  - Extending access into on-premises networks if Client VPN is associated with a TGW or VGW.  

- **VPN Types**:
  - **Full Tunnel**: All traffic (AWS + Internet) routes through the VPN.  
  - **Split Tunnel** (not default): Only AWS/VPC traffic routes through the VPN; Internet-bound traffic goes out locally.  

- **Authentication**:
  - **Certificate-based** (via ACM).  
  - **Identity-based** (Active Directory, SAML, or federated IdPs).  

- **Setup Workflow**:
  1. **Create Certificates in ACM**  
     - Server certificate for the VPN endpoint.  
     - Client certificates for users.  
     - Certificates are used to establish trust between client and server.  
  2. **Create Client VPN Endpoint** in AWS.  
  3. **Associate Subnets (ENIs)** across AZs for HA.  
  4. **Configure Authorization Rules** (which clients can access which networks).  
  5. **Add a DNS Server IP** (so clients can resolve hostnames inside the VPC).  
  6. **Download/OpenVPN configuration file** and distribute to clients.  
  7. Clients connect using an **OpenVPN-compatible client**.  

#### 3.2.1 Connection Sequence {#section-3-2-1-connection-sequence}

## 4. Route Tables {#section-4-route-tables}

- **VPC Route Tables**: Decide routing inside each VPC.  
- **TGW Route Tables**: Decide routing between VPCs, VPNs, and On-prem.  
- **Association**: Each attachment (VPC, VPN, DX) can only be linked to **one TGW RT**.  
- **Propagation**: Routes can automatically flow into TGW RTs (e.g., from VPN or On-prem).  

- **Routing Priority**:  
  - Inside VPC ‚Üí VPC RT applies.  
  - Across attachments ‚Üí TGW RT applies.  
  - **Longest prefix match** always wins.  
  - **Static routes** take precedence over propagated routes.  
  - If multiple propagated routes exist, AWS evaluates in this order:  
    1. Direct Connect (DX)  
    2. VPN Static  
    3. VPN BGP  
    4. AS_PATH length (shortest wins)  

- **Subnet Association**: Each subnet can only be associated with **one RT** (main or custom).  

- **CIDR Overlap**:  
  - Use separate RTs per subnet to send traffic to different VPCs with the same CIDR.  
  - Or rely on more specific prefixes, since routing favors specificity.  

- **Ingress Routing (Gateway Route Tables)**:  
  - Enables inspection/control of **inbound traffic flows**.  
  - Previously, RTs only controlled **outbound** traffic; ingress routing extends this capability for security appliances.  

---

## 5. Direct Connect {#section-5-direct-connect}

AWS Direct Connect (DX) provides a **dedicated, private network connection** between your on-premises environment and AWS. Unlike VPN (which traverses the Internet), DX offers **consistent latency, predictable bandwidth, and enterprise-grade reliability**.  

### 5.1 Direct Connect Physical Architecture {#section-5-1-direct-connect-physical-architecture}

- **Port Speeds**: 1 / 10 / 100 Gbps  
  - 1 Gbps ‚Üí `1000BASE-LX` (1310 nm)  
  - 10 Gbps ‚Üí `10GBASE-LR` (1310 nm)  
  - 100 Gbps ‚Üí `100GBASE-LR4`  
- **Medium**: Single-mode fiber only (no copper).  
- **Configuration**: Auto-negotiation disabled ‚Üí both ends must manually set **speed** and **full-duplex**.  
- **Routing**: Uses **BGP with MD5 authentication**.  
- **Optional**:  
  - **MACsec (802.1AE)** for Layer 2 encryption.  
  - **Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)** for fast failure detection.  

### 5.2 MACsec Security Layer {#section-5-2-macsec-security-layer}

DX traffic is not encrypted by default. **MACsec** secures the **physical hop** between your router and AWS‚Äôs DX router at the PoP.  

- **Scope**: Frame-level encryption (Layer 2).  
- **Guarantees**: Confidentiality, integrity, origin authentication, replay protection.  
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated, minimal overhead at 10/100 Gbps.  
- **Mechanism**: Secure Channels, Secure Associations, SCI identifiers, 16B tag + 16B ICV.  
- **Limitations**: Not end-to-end; only protects between directly connected devices. Use **IPsec over DX** if end-to-end encryption is required.  

### 5.3 Direct Connect Provisioning Workflow {#section-5-3-direct-connect-provisioning-workflow}

1. **LOA-CFA (Letter of Authorization ‚Äì Connecting Facility Assignment)**  
   - AWS allocates a port inside their cage at the DX location (PoP).  
   - You receive LOA-CFA to hand to your provider or colo staff.  

2. **Physical Cross-Connect**  
   - Fiber is patched between your cage/router and the AWS DX router at the PoP.  
   - Ports are set with matching speed/duplex.  

### 5.4 Direct Connect Virtual Interfaces {#section-5-4-direct-connect-virtual-interfaces}

DX is a **Layer 2 link**. To run multiple logical networks, DX uses **802.1Q VLANs**, each mapping to a **Virtual Interface (VIF)** on the AWS side.  
- **Each VIF = one VLAN + one BGP session.**  
- On the customer side: configure sub-interfaces (per VLAN) with BGP.  

**Types of VIFs**:  
1. **Private VIF**  
   - Connects to **VGW** (1 VPC) or **TGW** (multiple VPCs).  
   - Used for **private VPC IP ranges**.  
   - Region-specific (per DX location).  
   - 1 VIF = 1 VGW = 1 VPC (unless TGW is used).  
   - No built-in encryption.  

2. **Public VIF**  
   - Connects to **AWS public endpoints** (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, STS).  
   - AWS advertises **all public IP prefixes**; you advertise your **public IPs**.  
   - Global scope (all AWS regions).  
   - Not transitive: your prefixes are not re-shared by AWS.  
   - Can combine with VPN for **DX + VPN** (low latency + encryption).  

3. **Transit VIF**  
   - Connects via **DX Gateway (DXGW) ‚Üí TGW**.  
   - Scales to **multiple VPCs across accounts/regions**.  
   - Requires BGP.  
   - Enterprise-scale hub-and-spoke hybrid connectivity.  

### 5.5 Direct Connect Gateway {#section-5-5-direct-connect-gateway}

- DX is **per-region**, but DXGW allows sharing across accounts and regions.  
- **Public VIFs**: Can access all AWS regions (since public IPs are global).  
- **Private VIFs**: Normally regional, but DXGW extends them to multiple regions via VGWs or TGWs.  
- Enables **multi-account, multi-region hybrid architectures**.  

### 5.6 Operational Considerations {#section-5-6-operational-considerations}

- **Speed**: Up to 100 Gbps, depending on DX location/provider.  
- **Encryption**: Not built-in ‚Üí use **MACsec** (L2 hop-by-hop) or **VPN over DX** (end-to-end).  
- **Resiliency**: Use redundant DX links at different PoPs for HA.  
- **Cost**: Port-hour charges + data transfer (cheaper than Internet egress).  
- **Provisioning**: Weeks (physical cabling) vs minutes for VPN.  
- **Routing Priority**:  
  - Longest prefix match always wins.  
  - Static > propagated.  
  - Typically, DX > VPN for the same prefix.  
- **Best Practice**: DX + VPN (over DX Public VIF) = encrypted, resilient connectivity.

## 6. Domain Name System (DNS) {#section-6-domain-name-system-dns}

DNS (Domain Name System) resolves human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses or service endpoints. In AWS, **Route 53** provides DNS hosting, routing policies, and integration with AWS resources (via Alias records).  

üëâ **Important distinction**:  
- **DNS Hosting**: Runs authoritative DNS servers that store and answer queries for your domain‚Äôs records.  
  - Stores **zone files** (the authoritative set of DNS records for your domain).  
  - Uses **name servers (NS records)**, which are basically the servers that host and respond with your zone file data.  
  - Examples: Route 53, Cloudflare, GoDaddy DNS.  

- **TLD Registry / Registrar**: Manages ownership of domain names under a top-level domain (TLD), like `.com` or `.org`.  
  - The **registry** (e.g., Verisign for `.com`, PIR for `.org`) maintains the authoritative database of who owns each domain.  
  - The **registrar** (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap) is where you register, renew, or transfer domains.  

- These can be provided by the **same company** (e.g., GoDaddy = registrar + DNS host) or by **different ones** (e.g., register with Namecheap, host DNS with Route 53).

### 6.4 DNS Resolution Flow {#section-6-4-dns-resolution-flow}

1. You create a **Hosted Zone** in Route 53 for your domain (`example.com`).  
2. Route 53 assigns **4 authoritative name servers (NS records)** for the domain.  
3. You add DNS records (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc.) inside the hosted zone.  
4. When a client queries `example.com`, the DNS resolver follows the chain:  
   - Root ‚Üí TLD ‚Üí **Route 53 authoritative NS** (Amazon-managed).  
5. Route 53 authoritative servers return the DNS record (e.g., A record with an IP).  
6. Resolver caches and returns result to user ‚Üí user connects to the target resource.

### 6.5 DNSSEC Overview {#section-6-5-dnssec-overview}

**DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)** adds a **security layer** to DNS. Normal DNS just maps names ‚Üí IPs, but DNSSEC ensures responses are **authentic** and **untampered** by digitally signing DNS records.  

> üîë **Why we need DNSSEC**: Without it, DNS is vulnerable to **cache poisoning, spoofing, and MITM attacks**.  
> ‚úÖ **DNSSEC prevents this** by providing a **cryptographic chain of trust** from the **Root** ‚Üí **TLD** ‚Üí **Authoritative server**.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: DNSSEC does **not encrypt traffic** (unlike HTTPS). It only guarantees **authenticity + integrity**, not confidentiality.

#### 6.5.1 Key Concepts {#section-6-5-1-key-concepts}

- **Digital Signatures**:  
  - **Authoritative servers** sign records with a **private key**.  
  - **Resolvers** validate them with the **public key**.  

- **DNSSEC Records**:  
  - **DNSKEY** ‚Üí Public key of a DNS zone.  
  - **DS (Delegation Signer)** ‚Üí Stored in the parent zone, links child zone‚Äôs key.  
  - **RRSIG** ‚Üí Digital signature attached to DNS records.  

- **Chain of Trust**:  
  - Starts at the **Root zone** (trust anchor),  
  - Delegates to **TLD (.com)**,  
  - Passes down to the **Authoritative DNS** (e.g., Route 53).  

#### 6.5.2 Roles and Responsibilities {#section-6-5-2-roles-and-responsibilities}

- **Root & TLD Operators (ICANN, Verisign, etc.)** ‚Üí Maintain signed root/TLD zones.  
- **Domain Owners** ‚Üí Enable DNSSEC in their DNS service (e.g., Route 53), publish DS record at registrar.  
- **Resolvers (e.g., ISP, Google DNS, Cloudflare)** ‚Üí Validate signatures automatically.  
- **End Users** ‚Üí Do nothing; they just benefit from secure DNS responses.

### 6.6 Route 53 Resolver and Endpoints {#section-6-6-route53-resolver-endpoints}

By default, every **VPC** has an **Amazon-managed DNS resolver** at the reserved IP `VPC-CIDR+.2` (e.g., `10.0.0.2`).  
- Accessible from **all subnets** in the VPC.  
- Resolves **public DNS records** and **private hosted zones** linked to the VPC.  
- No setup required ‚Äî it‚Äôs built-in.  

üëâ Limitation: The default `.2` resolver only works **inside the VPC**. It cannot be queried from on-premises networks or other VPCs directly.

To integrate DNS across hybrid or multi-VPC environments, AWS provides **Route 53 Resolver Endpoints**:  

- **Inbound Endpoint**:  
  - On-premises DNS servers ‚Üí query AWS `.2` resolver via an ENI in the VPC.  
- **Outbound Endpoint**:  
  - VPC resources ‚Üí forward queries to on-premises DNS servers.  

These endpoints solve the **DNS boundary problem** where VPC and on-prem DNS could not previously resolve each other.

## 7. IPv6 in AWS {#section-7-ipv6-in-aws}

AWS VPCs support **dual-stack networking** (IPv4 + IPv6). Unlike IPv4, IPv6 is **globally unique and publicly routable**, which removes the need for NAT but requires careful access control.

### 7.1 Key Points {#section-7-1-key-points}

- **CIDR Allocation**:  
  - Each VPC gets an **Amazon-provided /56 IPv6 block**.  
  - Each subnet automatically receives a **/64 range** (one per subnet, up to 256 subnets per VPC).  

- **Routing**:  
  - IPv6 routes appear separately in route tables alongside IPv4 routes.  
  - Works with the same routing constructs (IGW, TGW, VGW, etc.), but must be explicitly added.  

- **Gateways**:  
  - **Internet Gateway (IGW)** ‚Üí allows **bidirectional IPv4 + IPv6**.  
  - **Egress-Only IGW** ‚Üí outbound-only for IPv6 (blocks unsolicited inbound).  

- **Service Support**:  
  - Must be enabled per VPC, subnet, and ENI.  
  - Not all AWS services support IPv6 (check service docs before enabling).  

- **No NAT Needed**:  
  - NAT Gateway is not required for IPv6 since all IPv6 addresses are globally routable. For IPv4, a NAT Gateway is needed because of address space limitations and the use of address masquerading (NAT) to share public IPs.
  - Security relies on **Security Groups / NACLs** instead of NAT hiding.  

### 7.2 Considerations {#section-7-2-considerations}

- Plan dual-stack carefully: some workloads may remain IPv4-only.  
- Use **Egress-Only IGW** to protect IPv6 workloads from unsolicited inbound traffic.  
- Validate which AWS services support IPv6 before rollout (e.g., some managed services may lag behind).  
- IPv6 helps with **address exhaustion** but introduces new **security + monitoring challenges**.  

‚ö° **Takeaway**:  
IPv6 in AWS = **globally routable addresses, no NAT, /56 per VPC, /64 per subnet, explicit routing, and egress-only IGW for outbound-only control**.
