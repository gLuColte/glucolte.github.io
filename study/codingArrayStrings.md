# Arrays & Strings

**Patterns to know:**  
- Two Pointers (fast/slow, inward/outward).  
- Sliding Window.  
- Prefix Sum / Difference Array.  
- Sorting + Greedy.  
- Binary Search on answer.

**How to identify:**  
- Input is just a flat array or string.  
- Asked to find subarray/subsequence with certain property.  
- "Longest/shortest substring" → usually sliding window.  
- "Find pair/triplet" → often two pointers + sorting.
