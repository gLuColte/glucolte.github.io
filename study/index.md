## System Design

### Topic-Specific Pages
The following are system design study pages (auto-generated):

<ul>
{% assign all_pages = site.pages | sort: "title" %}
{% for p in all_pages %}
  {% if p.url contains '/study/systemDesign' and p.url != '/study/' %}
    <li><a href="{{ p.url | relative_url }}">{{ p.title | default: p.url }}</a></li>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## LeetCode

### 🧭 Mindset for Problem Solving
- Restate the problem in your own words. Clarify input, output, and constraints.  
- Spot the structure:  
  - Array / String → two pointers, sliding window, hashing.  
  - Linked list → pointer tricks.  
  - Tree → DFS recursion, or BFS levels.  
  - Graph / Grid → BFS/DFS, Union-Find, Dijkstra.  
  - "Max/Min/Ways" → Dynamic Programming.  
  - "All possibilities" → Backtracking.  
- Start simple, then optimize. First find a brute force, then reduce complexity.  
- Trace with examples. Work through 2–3 small cases before coding.  
- Ask yourself: Is this problem about *searching*, *counting*, *optimizing*, or *enumerating*?
- If you are struggling for more than 15 minutes, check the solution, walk through and understand it, move on.
  - Leetcode is designed to be solved in 30 minutes-ish, if you can't solve it, don't dwell on it.

### ⏱ Complexity Rules (Cheat-Sheet)
- Additive: independent steps add → `O(n + m)`.  
- Multiplicative: nested loops multiply → `O(n × m)`.  
- Sorting: `O(n log n)` baseline.  
- Graphs:  
  - BFS/DFS = `O(n + m)` (nodes + edges).  
  - Dijkstra (heap) = `O((n + m) log n)`.  
- Hashing: avg `O(1)` for lookup/insert.  
- Divide & Conquer: often `O(n log n)`.  

👉 Always tie complexity back to input size.
