# /rules

Practical rules I try to follow.  
Not rigid laws, but reminders to save energy, stay sharp, and keep moving.

## Productivity
- If a task can be done in **2 minutes or less**, do it immediately.  
- If you’ll only do it once, **do it manually**; if it repeats, **automate**.  
- Don’t keep Slack/Outlook always on — **batch notifications** every hour; if it’s urgent, you’ll get paged.  
- Block **focus time in calendar**, even if it’s your personal email calendar.  
- Not every meeting deserves you. Attend only if you’ll **gain or contribute**.  
- Default to **asynchronous updates** (docs, notes, recordings) over live meetings.  
- Capture open loops (ideas, tasks, errands) into one trusted system (not your head).  
- When you feel unfocused (e.g. early morning), **reset your state**: stand up, take a 5-minute walk, breathe, then plan your top 3 priorities for the day.

## Focus & Energy
- Guard the **first 2 hours after lunch** — no email, no chat, just deep work.  
- Use a **single screen mode** when solving problems to reduce context-switching.  
- Take **5-minute breaks every hour** — stand, stretch, breathe.  
- Sleep is a performance enhancer. Prioritize 7+ hours as **non-negotiable**.  
- Limit caffeine after 2 PM. Tomorrow’s energy is part of today’s job.  
- Stretch mid-day or when you are tired/sleepy.  
- When things go wrong, give yourself **5 minutes to release** — complain, mourn, be angry if you need. After 5 minutes, take a breath and remind yourself: *“I can’t change it. Accept and move on.”*  ([Talk Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9yg5cDagJ0))

## Learning & Growth
- When you hit a bug, **read the error fully** before Googling.  
- If you can’t solve it in 30 minutes, **write down what you tried** before asking for help.  
- Build small “throwaway projects” to **learn faster than tutorials**.  
- Share what you learn — writing forces clarity, and helps others.  
- When advice conflicts, **test both**; keep what works for you.  

---

## Communication
- Default to **clear, short messages**. Respect people’s time.  
- Always **document decisions** (meeting notes, PR comments, design docs).  
- If it’s team knowledge, ask in public channels; if it’s personal, DM directly.  
- If you disagree, start with: *“Help me understand…”* instead of *“You’re wrong.”*  
- Praise in public, critique in private.  

---

## Creativity
- Save your best creative energy for mornings or when you feel most alert.  
- Don’t judge ideas during brainstorming — **separate creation and editing**.  
- Go analog sometimes: sketch on paper to unlock new connections.  
- Collect sparks: screenshots, quotes, code snippets — **your own swipe file**.  
- Walks and showers are creative work. Treat them as part of the process.  

---

## Career & Perspective
- Companies are not families — they are **teams with goals**. Don’t confuse the two.  
- Always know: *what am I learning here, and how does it grow me?*  
- Seek overlap between **your growth** and **company goals**. That’s win-win.  
- Don’t tie identity only to your job. Side projects and hobbies keep perspective.  
- When in doubt, optimize for **skills, people, and reputation** over short-term comfort.
