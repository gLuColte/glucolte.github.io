This is something I first got exposed to by a colleague at Amazon.  
It’s a simple but powerful reminder: **take a few minutes midday to stretch**.  
It breaks the sitting cycle, resets posture, and adds a bit of fun to the day.

✨ *Tip:* Bookmark this page or keep it open in a tab — take 5 minutes at lunch or mid-afternoon to go through one video. It’s a small thing, but it makes the rest of the day better.
