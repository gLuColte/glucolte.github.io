# Core Principles

These principles act as guiding lights for career and life. They are broad, enduring truths that anchor decision-making and provide context for daily rules. Rules may evolve, but principles remain stable.

---

### 1. **Inputs Over Outcomes**

Focus energy on actions that are within personal control—such as consistent learning, deliberate practice, and outreach—rather than on outcomes that depend on external factors like promotions, politics, or recognition. Mastering inputs ensures progress even when results are uncertain.

---

### 2. **The Power of Compounding**

Small, steady efforts—whether learning a new skill, improving a habit, or building relationships—accumulate into significant impact over time. Momentum grows not from intensity in bursts but from consistency across months and years.

---

### 3. **Clarity Wins**

Clarity in thinking, communication, and planning removes friction. Writing things down sharpens ideas and prevents confusion. Structure and documentation turn chaos into direction, enabling better collaboration and more effective problem-solving.

---

### 4. **Protect Energy**

Energy is the foundation of productivity. Without health, sleep, and rest, skills and opportunities cannot be fully leveraged. Protecting physical, mental, and emotional energy is not optional—it is the base upon which sustainable performance is built.

---

### 5. **Bias for Creation**

Progress comes from building, shipping, and putting ideas into the world. A rough but real result today beats a perfect plan tomorrow. Execution creates feedback, feedback drives learning, and learning refines direction.

---

### 6. **Relationships as Leverage**

Career growth is multiplied through people. Trust, reputation, and generosity compound like skills. Building authentic relationships provides opportunities, accelerates learning, and creates resilience during setbacks.

---

### 7. **Gratitude Grounds Ambition**

No one climbs alone. Appreciate those who help you—through mentorship, collaboration, or simple kindness. Say thank you, be polite, and acknowledge effort. Gratitude keeps ambition grounded and turns colleagues into allies.

---

### 8. **Design the Path Before Walking It**

Without structure, priorities scatter and energy leaks. Planning provides direction, creates guardrails, and prevents you from running in circles. A clear plan doesn’t remove uncertainty, but it ensures every step builds toward something larger.

---

### 9. **Work on the System, Not Just in It**

Execution delivers results, but systems make results repeatable. Always seek to improve workflows, tools, and habits. Invest in better ways of working, not just in completing tasks.

---

### 10. **Seek Many Voices, Not Just One**

No single mentor has all the answers. Surround yourself with multiple perspectives—mentors, peers, and advisors across different domains. Ask for advice, compare viewpoints, and develop judgment by synthesizing diverse inputs. Networking is not opportunistic—it is a discipline of curiosity, generosity, and dialogue.

## From Principles to Practice

Principles provide direction, but they are still broad. In difficult moments, choices are rarely between “good and bad,” but between two paths that both feel uncertain.  

One of the voices I return to often is **Kazuo Inamori**, a Japanese entrepreneur and philosopher. He expressed this tension through a set of paradoxical maxims — reminders that clarity often comes from choosing the harder, more disciplined option:

愛するか愛さないかで迷ったら、愛さない方を選べ。  
行くか行かないかで迷ったら、行く方を選べ。  
買うか買わないかで迷ったら、買わない方を選べ。  
言うか言わないかで迷ったら、言わない方を選べ。  
与えるか与えないかで迷ったら、与える方を選べ。  
食べるか食べないかで迷ったら、食べない方を選べ。  
やるかやらないかで迷ったら、やる方を選べ。

**Translated:**  
- When torn between love and not-love, choose not-love.  
- When hesitating to go or not go, choose to go.  
- When debating to buy or not buy, choose not to buy.  
- When wondering whether to speak or stay silent, choose silence.  
- When struggling to give or not give, choose to give.  
- When considering to eat or not to eat, choose not to eat.  
- When uncertain about doing or not doing, choose to do.

💡 These aren’t rules for comfort — they are rules for clarity. They turn broad principles into concrete pivots for decision-making.
